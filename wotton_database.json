Wotton informs Cranborne about the uncertain status of the papal election following the death of Clement VIII, the return of the Jesuit Robert Parsons to Rome, and the broader Spanish influence in the region.

[1] RIGHT HONOURABLE AND MY VERY GOOD LORD,\nYour Lordship receiveth herein (apart from other businesses) the draft of two instructions given unto two of mine own family; whereof the one hath succeeded ill by a sudden accident, the other is yet in contingency. \n[2] Of these it is fit for me to inform his Majesty both in respect of the things themselves, and also provisionally against such complaints as may peradventure be laid upon me from the Spanish side, as I have been already battered by the French. Therefore, though the enclosed papers contain the substance of my intent, both in the one and the other; yet I am desirous to speak unto your Lordship somewhat more particularly of them, as also of the parties employed, and mine own conceit upon the event.\n[3] The first was that to Milan, unto which I was drawn by divers considerations. I saw it to be the place where all the Spanish aids for the Low Countries were either originally levied, or through which they must pass: I had understood by your Lordship’s letters of the 23 of January his Majesty’s ends touching the subsistence of the States; I found that there was much hope laid upon the preparations of this year, and upon the person or purse of Spinola, who was then expected to come by Barcelona into Lombardie, and there to take the view of the Neapolitans and others, albeit afterwards he fell down through France. Lastly, I believed (and so I do still) that the matter between Fuentes and the Grisons would in conclusion produce extremities, according as the next Pope should prove after Clement VIII (who was then newly dead), or as the French King might take it.\nThese respects made me resolve to bestow an instrument of mine own in Milan, whence I did hope to derive some reasonable judgement upon what would follow, as well within Italie as abroad: neither did I much care (to confess the truth unto your Lordship) to breed a little amusement in this State about it, if it should be known; which indeed would give me here the more opinion.\nThe party whom I employed was one Rowland Woodward, a very honest person, and (notwithstanding his failing in this), I will be bold to say, of a very capable spirit, besides furnished at home by his own industry with good beginnings of the French, Italian, and Spanish languages; whereof he spoke the last best. I accompanied him, besides his instructions, with a letter to Count Fuentes, dormant in his hand, upon occasion lest, if he should encounter there with any that knew him to be one of mine, it might offer much jealousy; and in that case he was to deliver the letter, which under plain terms, recommended him to the Count as a gentleman that had come with me into these countries, and was now desirous to obtain more perfection of the Spanish language (whereof he had already some taste) in Milan, where that nation was very frequent, before his passage into Spain: which occasion I took likewise to commend unto him mine own service, having the honour to be placed so near him, and the like.\nBeing in this sort arrived in Milan, and settled there according to my directions at board, where there was company of great quality, on Good Friday last at dinner he was taken rudely from the table by some forty sbirri, and thence carried into the prison of the Inquisition, all his papers surprised, and among them the letter to the Count before then undelivered. \nThe fourth day following he was set at liberty, and brought before Fuentes, who excused his not having sent for him sooner, with those solemn days of devotion; and very handsomely bestowed the whole matter upon the Inquisitors, saying, questi religiosi sono sospettosi, causing his papers and all things else to be rendered again unto him. Whereof being advertised, upon considering the circumstances that his papers had doubtlessly been perused, and his ends discovered in them (though there was not so much bewrayed by anything that either Fuentes or the Inquisitors said), I drew him hither again.\nNow the judgement that is to be made upon it is, in my opinion, very obvious; for it was surely nothing but a device to get a sight of his papers, shadowed with religion. \nThe jealousy that moved it I take to have proceeded from the brother there of Sir William Standly, a pensioner of Spayne, and dependent upon the Court of Milan; who peradventure was the interpreter of his papers, and then met he with his own name in a cipher, which was taken about the party; yet after his releasement, meeting divers times with him, the countenances were (as he telleth me) clear enough between them.\nWith the event of this matter I am myself little troubled, being as ordinary in the course (which I now am in) as blows are to soldiers or gusts to mariners; with which I must comfort both the party employed, and myself, the employer of him upon mine own curiosity, and upon my desire not to be the barrenest instrument of those whom your Lordship (hath) planted in his Majesty’s service. But whereas I might justly expostulate with Fuentes the dealing against a subject of his Majesty’s by way of inquisition, I am bound to silence by the discovery of the party’s employment. \nOnly thus much I will add, that if by chance there should be framed out of it any complaint, it may please your Lordship to answer for me, that there hath been here from that side the like practices upon me; for having but one servant in my family of a contrary religion, the King of Spayne thought him a fit subject to work upon: which the party himself hath detected unto me, and I am contented to let the practice run on.\nThese are, my Lord, the effects of this mining and countermining profession.\nI will now pass to that other matter wherein, as your Lordship seeth, I have taken advantage under the merchants’ businesses, to do a little right unto myself. The whole design appeareth in the instructions. Only, I have concealed in them (as was meet) the words which Parsons used of his Majesty’s to the Viceroy of Naples, which were, (1) That his Majesty had since his coming to the Crown of England taken the bread of the Sacrament out of his mouth and flung it away contemptuously; (2) That the peace with Spayne is grounded upon nothing but an advantage of taking breath, his Majesty’s estates being exhausted; (3) That Papists are grown and growing even in the Court every day; (4) That though his Majesty hath been forced in his beginnings, as all new kings, to be moderate, yet he is likely, by little and little, to be worse than the late Queen against the Papists.\nThat his Majesty is naturally inclined to Fraunce, and can never be a good friend unto Spayne. These were the speeches delivered by him to the Viceroy, who is a gentleman, as I hear, of easy impression. The man that gave him access unto him (but who are inaccessible to Jesuits?) was his secretary, a Spaniard, with whom he had old acquaintance in Spain.

Wotton details his exchanges with Advocate Finetti, Balbi’s legal defender, noting his attempts to persuade Balbi to confess and deliver the stolen money and documents. He stresses his diplomatic balancing act—ensuring that Venice does not perceive English intervention as an overreach while still maintaining England’s demand for justice.

He discusses the case of Nicolo Balbi, a Venetian accused of murdering an English merchant, Nicholas Pardoe, and emphasizes his role as both an accuser and a negotiator in securing justice for the victim. Wotton details his exchanges with Advocate Finetti, Balbi’s legal defender, noting his attempts to persuade Balbi to confess and deliver the stolen money and documents. He stresses his diplomatic balancing act—ensuring that Venice does not perceive English intervention as an overreach while still maintaining England’s demand for justice. Wotton expresses confidence that Balbi will not escape punishment unless unforeseen circumstances intervene. He also briefly mentions that the papal conclave remains unresolved and that Robert Parsons, the prominent English Jesuit, has returned to Rome, hinting at further intelligence to be conveyed to the English crown.\"\n },\n \"markers_of_conspiratorial_language\": {\n   \"modal_verbs\": [\"would\", \"should\", \"could\"],\n   \"evaluative_language\": [\"rhetorically\", \"wise\", \"oppressed\", \"dis-exasperate\", \"persisting\", \"obstinately\", \"justifying\", \"constantly\", \"credit\", \"strange\", \"warm\", \"imaginable\", \"vile\"],\n   \"syntax_and_conditional_constructions\": [\"if he could then remove...\", \"since I had offered...\", \"without some most imaginable accident\"],\n   \"discourse_markers\": [\"it seemed\", \"as I think\", \"I know that\"],\n   \"punctuation\": [\"parentheses\", \"ellipsis\"]\n },\n \"analysis_overview\": {\n   \"segments\": [\n     \"Balbi case – first meeting with Advocate Finetti\",\n     \"Balbi case – second meeting with Advocate Finetti\",\n     \"Wotton's entreaty to Finetti\",\n     \"Finetti's reaction and Wotton's response\",\n     \"Wotton's confidence about Balbi's fate\",\n     \"Papal conclave and Robert Parsons\"\n   ],\n   \"no_of_excerpts\": {\n     \"observed\": 3,\n     \"rumored\": 3,\n     \"inferred\": 5\n   }\n },\n \"excerpts\": [\n   {\n     \"excerpt\": \"though Balbi very well knew how to take away the life of another man, yet it seemed he was mistaken in the saving of his own\",\n     \"gcma_classification\": \"inferred\",\n     \"explanation_of_chosen_gcma_type\": \"Wotton infers Balbi's state of mind without direct evidence; this reflects subjective deduction rather than factual reportage.\",\n     \"paranoia_detected\": false,\n     \"explanation_of_paranoia_detection\": \"There is no exaggerated or emotional language; Wotton is analytical in tone.\",\n     \"people_mentioned_in_excerpt\": [\"Nicolo Balbi\", \"Nicholas Pardoe\"],\n     \"segment\": \"Balbi case – first meeting with Advocate Finetti\"\n   },\n   {\n     \"excerpt\": \"I would now accuse him to have been not only the author, but the instrument of the death of Pardoe\",\n     \"gcma_classification\": \"inferred\",\n     \"explanation_of_chosen_gcma_type\": \"This is Wotton's conclusion from his gathered information but lacks intrinsic evidence in the excerpt.

Wotton highlights the political ramifications, including suspicions that Rome—the Pope or his agents—was behind the attack. He also notes that the Papal Nuncio in Venice is in both physical and mental distress, possibly from fear of repercussions. Wotton concludes with an update on Sarpi’s condition and reflects on the event as an instance of “God’s miraculous Providence.”",
      "transcription": "(Venice, 12 October 1607, Style of the Place)\nTO THE EARL OF SALISBURY\nRight Honourable and my very good Lord,\nHaving lately troubled your Lordship with so tedious a dispatch by Mr. Charles Bussy, I thought this place would not have produced again any extraordinary subject of discourse so soon as it hath done, as may appear unto his Majesty by the enclosed sentence of the Council of Ten yesterday published, whereof I have thought fit to explain in the margent certain terms of their tribunal. Now, seeing I am discharged of the historical part of the fact itself (which the said sentence doth so particularly comprehend), there remaineth only the critical part, touching what may be thought will ensue thereupon.\nAnd first it may seem somewhat strange for me to represent unto his Majesty for one effect thereof the likelihood at the present of the Pope’s Nuncio’s death: who is upon it fallen in so dangerous a distemperature both of his body and mind, as this morning, in the place where the residents and other instruments of State do meet, there was some discourse held of who might be fit to succeed him. And yet are not the physicians more troubled about him than the politiques in guessing at the ground of his disease: some affirming that it groweth out of a deep and sensible consideration of what difficulties this new and enormous accident is likely to breed in the point of perfect reconciling this State to his master. Nay, indeed, what exacerbation and virulence doth already appear in the voices and faces almost of all, from the senator to the gondolier, in their murmurings, in their circlings together, both open and private, in the pursuit of the offenders with no less provisions than if the Prince himself had been assailed, in the public care about the person offended, who hath been visited by the whole Signory, and Aquapendente (the most excellent anatomist and surgeon of the world) fetched from Padua by commandment about the cure, with divers other demonstrations, which surely will win this State more honour, and purchase unto them truer service, than anything that hath happened since the foundation of the city.\nYour Lordship seeth how I have been transported into this long period with the pleasure (as I must confess) which the matter giveth me. To resume therefore the causes of the Pope’s Nuncio’s disease of discontentment. Some attribute it to the fashion of the Duke of Venice towards him the Sunday morning, following the Friday of the attempt, at which time coming of course together, the Duke of Venice said nothing unto him, not so much as by way of entertainment touching the said accident; out of which silence he might easily gather that the root thereof was thought to be in Rome. Some derive this perturbation of his mind from a late accident not otherwise fit to be mingled with so serious matter as the present. The Prince and he were going in a procession, and passing by a convent of certain nuns, the patriarch’s Vicario (whether there by chance or so appointed) came forth of the church belonging to the said convent, with two other attired in sacerdotal habit, and offered unto the Prince and him the brush wherewith they sprinkle holy water; which in that company (being so surprised) he could not well refuse to kiss, though the said vicario be the very man for the avoiding of whose conversation the Pope’s Nuncio hath hitherto, since his coming, refused to sit in the Court of Inquisition, as hath been formerly signified unto your Lordship. Howsoever these causes, either singly or together, may have wrought in him, certain it is that this State is not over tender in professing their conceit that this late practice hath been fomented by the Pope, whereof his Majesty may perceive some kind of impression in the very sentence itself as I have been bold to note it out of the common observation here. And for his further information I will add (as I have learnt by curious means) that there is a post dispatched to their ambassador now in Rome, with express commandment that he shall keep his house, yea though the Pope should send for him, till farther order from hence; as if indeed they were desirous to be understood in their present jealousy.

Now, seeing I am discharged of the historical part of the fact itself (which the said sentence doth so particularly comprehend), there remaineth only the critical part, touching what may be thought will ensue thereupon.\\nAnd first it may seem somewhat strange for me to represent unto his Majesty for one effect thereof the likelihood at the present of the Pope’s Nuncio’s death: who is upon it fallen in so dangerous a distemperature both of his body and mind, as this morning, in the place where the residents and other instruments of State do meet, there was some discourse held of who might be fit to succeed him. And yet are not the physicians more troubled about him than the politiques in guessing at the ground of his disease: some affirming that it groweth out of a deep and sensible consideration of what difficulties this new and enormous accident is likely to breed in the point of perfect reconciling this State to his master. Nay, indeed, what exacerbation and virulence doth already appear in the voices and faces almost of all, from the senator to the gondolier, in their murmurings, in their circlings together, both open and private, in the pursuit of the offenders with no less provisions than if the Prince himself had been assailed, in the public care about the person offended, who hath been visited by the whole Signory, and Aquapendente (the most excellent anatomist and surgeon of the world) fetched from Padua by commandment about the cure, with divers other demonstrations, which surely will win this State more honour, and purchase unto them truer service, than anything that hath happened since the foundation of the city.\\nYour Lordship seeth how I have been transported into this long period with the pleasure (as I must confess) which the matter giveth me. To resume therefore the causes of the Pope’s Nuncio’s disease of discontentment. Some attribute it to the fashion of the Duke of Venice towards him the Sunday morning, following the Friday of the attempt, at which time coming of course together, the Duke of Venice said nothing unto him, not so much as by way of entertainment touching the said accident; out of which silence he might easily gather that the root thereof was thought to be in Rome. Some derive this perturbation of his mind from a late accident not otherwise fit to be mingled with so serious matter as the present. The Prince and he were going in a procession, and passing by a convent of certain nuns, the patriarch’s Vicario (whether there by chance or so appointed) came forth of the church belonging to the said convent, with two other attired in sacerdotal habit, and offered unto the Prince and him the brush wherewith they sprinkle holy water; which in that company (being so surprised) he could not well refuse to kiss, though the said vicario be the very man for the avoiding of whose conversation the Pope’s Nuncio hath hitherto, since his coming, refused to sit in the Court of Inquisition, as hath been formerly signified unto your Lordship. Howsoever these causes, either singly or together, may have wrought in him, certain it is that this State is not over tender in professing their conceit that this late practice hath been fomented by the Pope, whereof his Majesty may perceive some kind of impression in the very sentence itself as I have been bold to note it out of the common observation here. And for his further information I will add (as I have learnt by curious means) that there is a post dispatched to their ambassador now in Rome, with express commandment that he shall keep his house, yea though the Pope should send for him, till farther order from hence; as if indeed they were desirous to be understood in their present jealousy. This is all that I can as yet discourse unto his Majesty touching the affections that are likely to ensue.\\nThe friar is almost recovered of his hurts, which were not so dangerous nor painful as they are described ad pompam in the sentence, nor the stilet poisoned, as was thought, by being left in the wound: but surely altogether it may serve for a pattern of God’s miraculous Providence, as we all hope that he hath determined in His invisible wisdom to work great effects upon it.\\nAnd so humbly beseeching your Lordship to excuse this hasty dispatch in a confused and troubled time, I rest,\\nYour Lordship’s always bound to honour and serve you,\\nHenry Wotton.\",\n \"metadata\": {\n   \"document_type\": \"letter\",\n   \"author\": \"Henry Wotton\",\n   \"recipient\": \"Robert Cecil, first earl of Salisbury\",\n   \"date_place\": \"12-Oct-1607, Venice\",\n   \"keywords\": \"Wotton, Cecil, attempted assassination, Paolo Sarpi, Venetian Council of Ten, the Pope, Papal Nuncio in Venice\",\n   \"abstract\": \"Henry Wotton writes from Venice on 12 October 1607 to Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, reporting on the recent attempted assassination of the Venetian theologian Paolo Sarpi.

Yet we have cleared ourselves of the vain conceit touching the surprise of Bolduc.\nThe Diet of Germany is as cold as the weather, some princes refusing to send thither so much as their ambassadors, and few appearing personally, through a general distaste taken against the Emperor for making the Archduke Ferdinando his representative, a prince wholly in the power of the Jesuits.\nHere the case of the Cavalier Angelo Badoero hath been now published in the Grand Council in this form, that having passed determinedly between him and the public minister of a prince here resident, with consent of two friars, in the cell of one of them, a secret conference from two hours before sunset till more than two hours of the night, without any notice thereof given by him to the State, either before or after; he hath therefore been sentenced by the Council of Ten to remain one whole year in prison; which term expired, to be afterwards for ever incapable at home of entering into any of the secret councils, and abroad of receiving any annual benefit from any foreign prince, in which case he shall be understood guilty of rebellion; moreover, that if ever he shall depart out of the Venetian dominion he shall be understood ex tunc definitely banished, and his goods confiscated. The two friars in twenty-four hours to depart the city, and in three days the dominion, upon pain of death; which hath been accordingly executed, notwithstanding the Nuncio his intercession against that point only of the sentence, with notorious simplicity and derision, being an interested party in the case, and (to make up the sport) he is said in College to have let fall these words, that the Pope should know of it, as it were by way of commination, at which they could scant even before him hold their countenances.\nThus have I now once more troubled your Lordship with this gentleman’s process, wherein I must add this farther, that he failed in the first ballotation, but two balls of losing his head on a public scaffold and the friars of being drowned.\nFor the conclusion of the present, I must advertise your Lordship of the disastrous end at Padua of Sir Julius Caesar’s eldest son, who two days since in the morning was slain in the public street by the usher of a fencer, from whom he had the day before in his own school received some affront.\nI have advertised his father of the particularity thereof by Captain Pinner, whom my letter will overtake in Augusta, being departed hence but two days since with a very important dispatch unto his Majesty, and the picture mentioned in your Lordship’s last.\nAnd so for the present I commit your Lordship to the God of Heaven.\nYour Lordship’s always bound to honour and serve you,\nHENRY WOTTON\n\nApplication of the GraCM Matrix (Grammar of Conspiracy in Historical Texts)",

Even before Wotton could present a copy to the Doge formally, the Doge had already received one from England and consulted with a “party” (almost certainly Paolo Sarpi). The book has sparked discussion among “residents and other instruments of state.” Wotton requests more copies of the Apologia and additional Protestant works (referencing a catalog Salisbury sent), hoping to distribute them in Venice for “a great many” who might be receptive. In particular, he wants small–format editions of Bishop John Jewel’s Apology, well–suited for discreet circulation and influencing Venetian opinion. Wotton closes by noting a brewing conflict in Austria between Emperor Rudolf II and his brother Archduke Matthias, stemming from a dispute over religious freedom in Hungary and adjacent regions.\n",

Since then the matter is dispersed among the residents and other instruments of state upon the place, and it is grown (as is fit it should) a subject of much discourse.\n\tI beseech your Lordship (according to your promise) that I may have more of them, and likewise of those other authors (whereof you have sent me a catalogue) touching the progress of reformation and steps (as I may call it) of the Truth, which, because they will make a bigger bulk, may be sent by sea; and I assure your Lordship here is a State where we shall find vent for a great many of them, in which respect I must be bold to wish that Jewell’s Apology were reprinted in the little form, and some two hundred of them sent me; for being besides the matter eloquently penned, and in respect of the smallness of easy dispersion, I can think of nothing so proper for these young Christians.\n\tMy next unto your Lordship is likely to be very troublesome, in foresight whereof I will here end the present; committing your safety to the God of Heaven, and for all your favours humbly resting,\n\tYour Lordship’s always bound to honour and serve you,\nHENRY WOTTON.\n\tOur news out of Austria inclineth to some notable division between the Emperor and his brother Mathias, who having (as it should seem by sufficient warrant) confirmed unto the Hungarians and adjacent provinces the liberty of conscience, which the Emperor would retract, the matter beginneth to grow unto public arms, Moravia being already in motu. God bless His own cause.\n(Some minor spelling regularized and bracketed text removed for clarity.)\nConspiratorial Analysis\n\t1.\tCovert or Discreet Distribution of Books\n\t•\tWotton carefully avoids presenting the Apologia to the Doge “publicly” for “some respects which shall be signified.” This implies a cautious, quasi–secret method of introducing Protestant works into a Catholic state—soft propaganda aimed at winning favor with Venice’s ruling circles.\n\t2.\tReliance on “the Party Your Lordship Knoweth”\n\t•\tWotton alludes to a known confidant (almost certainly Fra Paolo Sarpi) whom the Doge “sent for” to discuss James’s book. This indicates an insider or collaborator within Venice’s administration to facilitate or interpret the text, again hinting at behind–the–scenes religious and political maneuvering.\n\t3.\tAppeal for More Material (“Vent for a Great Many”)\n\t•\tWotton’s encouragement that large shipments of reformation texts be sent “by sea” underscores the scale of his ambition—quietly saturating Venetian intellectual circles with Protestant arguments to diminish papal authority in the region.\n\t4.\tWider European Implications\n\t•\tThe letter also mentions a significant Habsburg family conflict over religious liberties in Austria and Hungary. Connecting these Austrian troubles with the Venetian scenario, Wotton frames both as part of a larger tension between Protestant or libertarian forces and reactionary Catholic rulers. Thus, he sees these theological controversies as potentially conspiratorial in nature, with shifting alliances threatening old power structures.\nOverall, while Wotton’s tone remains diplomatic, his request for discreet distribution of books and acknowledgment of an in–State ally reveals a low–key propaganda campaign that can be seen as conspiratorial from a Roman Catholic viewpoint.",

The Venetian ambassador in Rome informed the Duke of Venice that the Pope, after hearing complaints from Cardinal Lanfranco, angrily denounced Fulgenzio’s sermons, asserting that preaching the pure Gospel and Scripture amounted to an attack on the Catholic faith. The Venetian Senate, upon hearing this remark, reacted with murmurs and scandal, perceiving the Pope’s words as proof of the Church’s suppression of biblical teaching. Paolo Sarpi (Padre Paulo), a leading Venetian theologian, saw this as a key moment in exposing Rome’s hostility toward religious reform, believing it would help open the eyes of the Venetian authorities to papal overreach. This letter underscores the widening rift between Venice and Rome, highlighting the Venetian desire for religious independence and the increasing tension over Protestant-leaning reforms within the Republic.",

The Venetian Senate, upon hearing this remark, reacted with murmurs and scandal, perceiving the Pope’s words as proof of the Church’s suppression of biblical teaching. Paolo Sarpi (Padre Paulo), a leading Venetian theologian, saw this as a key moment in exposing Rome’s hostility toward religious reform, believing it would help open the eyes of the Venetian authorities to papal overreach.

      "abstract": "In this letter, Henry Wotton informs the Earl of Salisbury about the prohibition of King James I’s book, Apologia pro iureamento fidelitatis, in Venice. He attributes the censorship to the Papal Nuncio, who allegedly took advantage of the Doge’s illness to secure the Venetian College’s approval for the ban. Wotton expresses both skepticism and frustration, noting that while the prohibition was issued, it did not explicitly name James I as the author, nor did it impose penalties on booksellers. He employs an informant, Francesco Biondi, to investigate, revealing that copies are expected from Basel, and that a prominent bookseller, Giambattista Ciotti, remains willing to supply them. Wotton characterizes Ciotti as “Jesuitical,” reinforcing his anti-Jesuit conspiratorial lens. He resolves to publicly protest the prohibition and promises a detailed report to James I in his next letter. The letter blends genuine diplomatic concerns with Wotton’s conspiratorial interpretation of Catholic influence in Venice.",

Presently, I acknowledge receipt of the one from the first of this month, from which I perceive the necessity France has of making some good provision against the Jesuits; undoubtedly, the interests of one are incompatible with those of the other. I do believe the Reformed will give thought to this, and that from there some remedy will emerge; otherwise, I foresee civil war ignited.\nYour Lordship will have received, together with my previous [letter],\n[p. 198 modifica]\nthe Spanish decree against Baronius’s eleventh volume, which, although it forbids only the part concerning the monarchy of Sicily, nonetheless seems to me a stain upon the entire work, and also upon the author himself, who is given epithets that impugn both the conscience and honesty of the writer.\nThe task Your Lordship mentions regarding Signor Casaubon will bear fruit, and I shall ensure it will be effectively done by Wotton, who was ambassador here. I believe that the great preparations being made for the defense of Geneva will dissolve all designs, if indeed there were any; as for myself, I think they were rather directed toward Bern. Your Lordship can be assured that the Duke of Savoy is restless, and he will inflict some great harm either upon France, or upon Spain, or upon Italy, or upon himself. It was not good advice that Bouillon gave in sending his son to Spain, and I fear France will continue to make errors like this.\nIn Italy, we have nothing new, except that Spain has revoked 13,000 ducats of income from the Constable, which he held in the Kingdom of Naples; and it is rumored they plan to take from him also the constableship itself, which amounts to an income of 11,000 [ducats].\n[p. 199 modifica]\nThis gives much food for thought, as the Spanish are customarily prodigal in giving rather than inclined toward the contrary. However, these things do not cause great worry, as it is certain that this king absolutely desires peace in Italy.\nEveryone’s eyes are turned toward the affairs of Germany, which are of such significance and consequence that one could hardly imagine greater. Above all, I remain amazed that, while it is well known that the Jesuits were authors and instigators of all the evil that has occurred, they nonetheless remain exempt from the dangers to which the other side is exposed, and are secure to continue further fueling the fire. It pleases God thus to blind the world, so that it does not see clearly in the sunlight.\nThe Apology of Richéome is a book too large to send by courier. I would not want Your Lordship to be troubled by this, as I will arrange for it to reach Frankfurt, from where it will arrive to me along with other books from the fair.\nI have seen the Apology made on behalf of the Jesuits by the Archdeacon of Rouen—a very crafty thing, as it provides material for many arguments. If the Sorbonne publishes the decree it made on February 1, I would consider it a singular favor to receive a copy; but if they do not publish it, it is not of great concern.\nOne thing makes me doubtful, about which I desire explanation from Your Lordship at your convenience. The king of France is ten years old, an age at which, in my view, a person has considerable understanding and can say, “I wish it”; yet I do not hear him mentioned, as if he were still in swaddling clothes. I wish that Your Lordship might be entrusted with attending the General Congregation, and I would hope some good fruit would come of it; for this I pray to God, that it may be fulfilled.\n[p. 200 modifica]\nI also pray to God that He grant Your Lordship every true blessing; to whom I kiss the hand, along with Signor Molino and Father Fulgenzio.\nFrom Venice, March 29, 1611.",

      "abstract": "This letter, dated May 22, 1612, from Venice and addressed to Jérôme de l’Isle Groslot, discusses various political and religious matters in Europe, with a particular focus on Jesuit influence, the role of England, and ongoing diplomatic maneuvers. Sarpi expresses concern over the increasing confusion in France, particularly regarding a Jesuit-inspired declaration of pardon. He references the case of Edmond Richer, whose appeal documents were sent by Leschassier, and laments the increasing Spanish influence over France. Sarpi also touches upon the diplomatic activity of the English ambassador Henry Wotton in Turin, particularly regarding a possible marriage alliance and Savoy’s shifting political alignments. The letter further highlights Venice’s ongoing negotiations with the Grisons and speculates on Jesuit maneuvering regarding a Franco-Spanish marriage. The closing section discusses the return of Barbarigo and his expected future diplomatic appointment.",
      "transcription": "CCIX. — Al signor De l’Isle Groslot.1\nCon la mia solita riverenza e contentezza, ho ricevuto quella di V.S. del primo maggio; di che le rendo grazie, e specialmente per la risposta di Casaubono al cardinale, che mi pare opera buona e bella. Sento ben con dispiacere che le cose di cotesto regno s’incamminino a qualche confusione, ed in particolare la dichiarazione del perdono, che mi pare appunto un’invenzione gesuitica; e non so in me medesimo vedere come un tal principio non sia per aver conseguenza deplorabile, se dalla bontà divina non vi è posto qualche rimedio singolare e straordinario. Monsieur l’Eschassier mi ha mandato gli atti dell’appellazione di Richer, e son restato assai maravigliato, parendomi la libertà di Francia incatenata con vincoli di Spagna.\nQui in Italia non abbiamo cosa nuova. Il papa cede alla Repubblica in tutto quello dove conosce le ragioni sue, e questo fa li nostri negligenti, anzi rilassati; ch’è pernicioso per la Repubblica. Si aspetta in Torino il cavaliere Wotton, ambasciatore della maestà d’Inghilterra a quell’Altezza, e si preparano onori grandissimi da farli. Il duca è andato sino a Rivoli per trattenersi liberamente con lui un giorno, e intendere il sodo di quello che porta. Il suo ingresso in Torino sarà con incontro del cardinale2 e principe, punto molto importante, quanto s’aspetta al cardinale. Tengono che l’ambasceria sia per la trattazione del matrimonio. Io però riputando che \n[p. 311 modifica]\nsia concluso col Palatino, vado credendo che il duca di Savoia, vedendo levato l’equilibrio di Francia e di Spagna e ambidue poste in una sola bilancia, pensi di assicurare le cose sue accostandosi a chi lo può difendere. Se il re d’Inghilterra non fosse dottore, si potrebbe sperare qualche bene; e sarebbe un gran principio, perchè Spagna non si può vincere, se non levato il pretesto di religione; nè questo si leverà, se non introducendo Riformati in Italia;3 e se il re sapesse fare, sarebbe facile e in Torino e qui.\nLa Repubblica negozia lega con Grisoni. Per questa strada si potrebbe fare qualche cosa, se dimandassero esercizi di religione in Venezia. Io sono avvisato per cosa certa, che monsieur Pascal in Grisoni ha fatto solennissimo giuramento in pubblico, che non ci è nessuna conclusione di matrimonio tra Francia e Spagna. Questo non so come si salverà, nè se li Gesuiti avranno equivocazione per trovarvi ripiego.\nNon sarò più lungo in questo giorno per difetto e di materia e di tempo. Le dirò solamente, che il signor Barbarigo è ritornato, e si risolve di non voler Spagna; onde li toccherà Francia, ma sarà l’anno venturo. Abbiamo fatto più volte discorsi di lei, ed ultimamente gli ho letto la sua e fatto le salutazioni; di che egli ne rende grazie e la risaluta con gli amici.\nDi Venezia, li 22 maggio 1612.\n\nNote\n↑ Stampata nella raccolta di Ginevra, pag. 474.\n↑ Maurizio di Savoia, creato cardinale nel 1605.\n↑ Lasciam ad altri la cura di assegnare il lor giusto valore a queste, pur troppo, esplicite parole. Le quali, tuttavolta non suonano, al senso nostro, che il Sarpi volesse in realtà protestantizzare nè Venezia nè l’Italia.\n\nTHE ENGLISH TRANSLATION\nCCIX. — To Signor De l’Isle Groslot.\nWith my usual reverence and pleasure, I have received your Lordship’s letter of May 1, for which I offer my thanks, especially for Casaubon’s reply to the cardinal, which appears to me a good and fine work. I do hear with displeasure that affairs in that kingdom are heading toward some confusion, particularly the declaration of pardon, which seems to me exactly a Jesuit invention. I cannot understand within myself how such a principle could fail to have deplorable consequences unless some singular and extraordinary remedy is granted by divine goodness. Monsieur l’Eschassier sent me the proceedings of Richer’s appeal, and I remain quite astonished, as it seems to me the liberty of France is bound in chains by Spain.\nHere in Italy we have nothing new. The pope yields to the Republic in all matters where he recognizes its rights, and this makes our people negligent, or rather lax, which is pernicious for the Republic. The knight Wotton, ambassador of His Majesty of England to that Highness, is expected in Turin, and great honors are being prepared for him. The duke went as far as Rivoli to spend a day privately with him and to understand the essence of his mission. His entry into Turin will be met by the cardinal and the prince—a very significant point, especially with respect to the cardinal. It is believed that the embassy is related to negotiations concerning the marriage. However, considering that\n[p. 311 modifica]\nthe matter is settled with the Palatine, I believe the duke of Savoy, seeing the equilibrium between France and Spain disrupted and both placed into a single scale, is thinking of securing his affairs by aligning himself with those who can defend him. If the king of England were not a scholar, one might hope for some good; and it would be an important beginning, because Spain cannot be defeated without removing the pretext of religion, and this pretext will not be removed unless the Reformed are introduced into Italy. And if the king knew how to act, it would be easy, both in Turin and here.\nThe Republic is negotiating an alliance with the Grisons. Something could be done in this direction if they asked for freedom of religious practice in Venice. I am reliably informed that Monsieur Pascal, in the Grisons, made a most solemn public oath that there is no conclusion of marriage between France and Spain. I do not know how this can be upheld, nor whether the Jesuits will resort to equivocation to find a remedy.\nI will not write more today due to lack of both material and time. I will only inform you that Signor Barbarigo has returned and has decided against supporting Spain; thus, he will support France, but it will be next year. We have spoken of you several times, and recently I read him your letter and conveyed your greetings, for which he thanks you and sends greetings back to you along with friends.\nFrom Venice, May 22, 1612.\nNotes\n\t1.\tPrinted in the Geneva collection, p. 474.\n\t2.\tMaurice of Savoy, made cardinal in 1605.\n\t3.\tLet others assign their proper value to these, unfortunately too explicit, words. Nevertheless, in our opinion, these do not mean that Sarpi actually intended to Protestantize either Venice or Italy.",

      "abstract": "This letter, written by Paolo Sarpi to Jérôme de l’Isle Groslot on June 5, 1612, reflects his ongoing concerns about European power dynamics, religious conflicts, and Jesuit influence. Sarpi discusses diplomatic tensions involving Spain, France, England, and the Protestant states, highlighting his suspicion that Spain and the Jesuits are orchestrating broader conspiracies. He notes the Spanish effort to control religious orders in Rome and their attempt to sow discord among Protestants. The letter also details an incident in which the Jesuits in Palermo manipulated an inheritance, only to be thwarted by the Spanish viceroy. Sarpi further comments on a political purge in Parma, where a Jesuit sermon followed the execution of conspirators.

      "transcription": "CCX. — Al signor De l’Isle Groslot.1\nCrescono ogni giorno li oblighi miei verso V.S., e diminuiscono in me li modi di renderne alcuna ricompensa. Insieme con le sue delli 17 e 18 maggio da Lione, ho ricevuto il libro di Cuiacio, insieme con li altri che si è piaciuto mandarmi. Vorrei saper che cosa le fusse grato ricever di qua, non perchè io tratti con lei di ricompensazione, ma solo per dimostrar che riconosco li favori ricevuti. Le sue lettere con li libri furono portate dall’estraordinario nostro, il quale non passò...2 in Inghilterra, che non era venuto costì se non per la cosa di Grisoni; e ha avuto risposta assai poco pertinente, per la quale ognuno viene certificato che così non vi è altra mira, salvo il servizio di Spagna.\nQuello che mi fa molto maravigliare in questo proposito, è che monsignor Pascale abbia fatto solenni e pubblici giuramenti per persuadere a quei popoli, non esser vero che vi sia alcuna conclusione di matrimonio tra Francia e Spagna. Con tutte queste difficoltà, nondimeno, spero che non saremo serrati in Italia, sì come vorrebbono quelli che dovrebbono più degli altri pretendere l’apertura di quella porta.\nHo sentito molto dispiacere della maniera tenuta dal signor Gussoni, se bene l’attribuisco più a mancamento di espressioni di buona volontà, che a difetto di quello. Con tutto ciò, io li toccherò \n[p. 313 modifica]\nqualche parola, perchè quando la corrispondenza non fosse in modo conveniente, meglio sarebbe troncarla. Con questa occasione li dirò, che li amici di Barbarigo risolvono che un altro vadi in Spagna; onde a lui toccherà Francia, ma questo non sarà se non l’anno seguente.\nA Roma hanno imparato che la opposizione e contenzione non giova loro, ma mette li altri in vigilante difesa; e però, con dissimulata negligenza e con dimostrazione di creder ogni cosa, inducono negligenza vera e un sonno profondo. È verissimo che la tradizione di Badoero ha conseguenze, ma ancora segrete e grandi. Spero in Dio che questa sarà stata una alterazione di salute, e il fine sarà buono.\nMi dà gran gelosia la controversia che vedo nascere tra Reformati nelle cose di religione, massime essendone già nate altre molto pericolose in Olanda. Piacerà a Dio impedire i cattivi disegni; chè, quanto a me, tra tutte le imprese spagnuole, questa mi pare la maggiore, aver potuto dividere li Ugonotti. Ma perchè bene spesso si vede che Dio rivolta in bene le cose incommode, e che le desiderate tornano in male, voglio sperar nella Maestà sua divina, che farà terminare a buon fine e queste e coteste cose, se bene al presente noi non sappiamo divinar esito buono.\nIn Italia non abbiamo cosa di momento, perchè a Roma si continua il modo usato. Questo solo è di considerazione: che dovendosi creare a questa Pentecoste in Roma un generale dell’ordine di San Domenico e un altro di San Francesco, è stato comandato a Don Francesco di Castro, ambasciatore \n[p. 314 modifica]\nspagnuolo, che si ritrova a Napoli, di andar immediate a Roma, per assistere a quei capitoli e procurare che siano eletti Spagnuoli.\nIl cavaliere Wotton si ritrova a Torino ambasciatore del re della Gran Brettagna; e se bene si dice che il suo negoziato non porti altro, salvo che il dar esclusione al duca del matrimonio della principessa, nondimeno molte congetture vi sono che quel duca, vedendo la stretta unione di Francia e di Spagna, pensi che sia necessario qualche contrappeso. Pensiero che piacesse a Dio entrasse nella mente di quelli ai quali è più necessario!\nIl duca di Parma in questi giorni ha fatto morire dieci persone,3 fra quali sette sono nobili titolati, per conspirazione contro la persona sua; e si tiene per certo che la confiscazione di tutti li beni loro, eccetto che delli feudi, sarà applicata alli Gesuiti. Ma in Palermo a questi buoni Padri è avvenuto un bell’accidente. S’è morto un gentiluomo ricco, molto loro divoto, avendo fatto testamento, e instituito un figliuolo unico suo e li Padri insieme, dando l’esecuzione del testamento ad essi, con facuità di divider l’eredità come fosse piaciuto loro, e dar al figlio \n[p. 315 modifica]\nquella parte che li fosse parsa conveniente. Li Padri hanno diviso il tutto in dieci parti, e datone una al figliuolo, e nove ritenute per loro. Di questa così grande inegualità il figliuolo si è querelato al duca di Ossuna vicerè, il quale udite le ragioni da ambe le parti, ha confermato la divisione, ma voltati le termini: che al figliuolo tocchino le nove parti, e alli Padri una.\nSe ben sono incerto, quando la presente debbe capitare in mano di V.S., non ho però voluto mancar di questo debito per baciarle la mano; il che fanno anco li amici.\nDi Venezia, il dì 5 giugno 1612.\n\nNote\n↑ Impressa come sopra, pag. 477.\n↑ È, per via d’asterischi, questo segno di lacuna nella prima stampa.\n↑ Eccone i nomi (e Vedi la nostra nota a pag. 221) — Contessa Barbara Sanseverina, conte Orazio Simonetta suo marito, marchese Gio. Girolamo di Sala figlio di Barbara, conte Alfonso Sanvitale, marchese Gio. Francesco Sanvitale, conte Pio Torelli, conte Gio. Batista Masi, capitano Bartolommeo Rovezan da Reggio, Oliviero de Olivieri parmigiano, Onofrio Martani perugino. I tre ultimi vennero impiccati: “Dopo questo fatto, un Padre Gesuita fece un sermone, stando nel palco dove avevano decapitati detti Signori, con animare la città ad esser fedele al suo Principe, et non atterrirsi per detto spettacolo.„ Tale è la conclusione di un racconto contemporaneo.\n\nTHE ENGLISH TRANSLATION\nCCX. — To Signor De l’Isle Groslot.\nMy obligations to Your Lordship grow daily, and my means of providing any recompense diminish. Together with your letters from Lyon dated May 17 and 18, I received the book by Cujas, along with the others you kindly sent me. I would like to know what might please you to receive from here—not because I intend to speak of compensation, but merely to show my recognition of the favors received. Your letters and books were brought by our extraordinary courier, who did not pass… [lacuna in original text] into England, having come only for the matter of the Grisons, and he received a rather irrelevant reply, confirming to everyone that there is no other aim but serving Spain’s interests.\nWhat greatly astonishes me in this matter is that Monsignor Pascal has made solemn and public oaths to persuade those people that it is not true that any marriage agreement has been reached between France and Spain. Despite all these difficulties, nevertheless, I hope we will not be enclosed in Italy, as some would wish, particularly those who, more than others, should be interested in opening that door.\nI was greatly displeased by the manner of Signor Gussoni, although I attribute this more to a failure to express goodwill properly rather than an actual lack of it. Nevertheless, I shall address\n[p. 313 modifica]\na few words to him, since if the correspondence is not conducted appropriately, it would be better to terminate it. On this occasion, I will tell you that Barbarigo’s friends have resolved that another should go to Spain; thus, Barbarigo will be assigned France, but this will only occur next year.\nIn Rome, they have learned that opposition and contention do them no good but rather put others on vigilant defense; therefore, with feigned negligence and a pretense of believing everything, they induce genuine negligence and deep sleep. It is very true that Badoer’s tradition has consequences, still secret and substantial. I trust in God that this is merely a change in condition, and that the end result will be good.\nI am greatly troubled by the controversy I see arising among the Reformed in matters of religion, especially since others, already very dangerous, have arisen in Holland. May God prevent evil designs, as for my part, among all the Spanish undertakings, this seems to me the greatest: having succeeded in dividing the Huguenots. Yet since we often see God turning inconvenient matters to good ends, and desirable ones to harm, I will trust in His Divine Majesty, that he will bring both these matters and those of your side to a good conclusion, although presently we cannot foresee a favorable outcome.\nIn Italy, we have nothing significant, since in Rome the usual course continues. The only matter worth noting is this: since at Pentecost this year in Rome, a general of the Order of Saint Dominic and another of Saint Francis must be elected, Don Francisco di Castro, the Spanish ambassador\n[p. 314 modifica]\nwho is presently in Naples, has been ordered to go immediately to Rome, to attend those chapters and ensure that Spaniards are elected.\nThe knight Wotton is currently in Turin as ambassador of the king of Great Britain; and although it is said his negotiation concerns nothing else but excluding the duke from the marriage of the princess, nevertheless there are many conjectures that the duke, seeing the tight union of France and Spain, believes some counterweight necessary—a thought I pray God would put into the minds of those who most need it!\nIn these days, the duke of Parma has had ten persons put to death, among whom seven are nobles with titles, due to a conspiracy against his person; and it is held for certain that the confiscation of all their property, except their feudal holdings, will be applied to the Jesuits. But in Palermo a lovely incident has occurred to these good Fathers. A wealthy gentleman, very devoted to them, died having made a will naming his only son and the Fathers as heirs jointly, entrusting execution of the will to them, with the authority to divide the inheritance however they pleased, giving to the son\n[p. 315 modifica]\nthe portion they deemed appropriate. The Fathers divided the entire estate into ten parts, giving one part to the son and keeping nine for themselves. Because of this great inequality, the son appealed to the duke of Ossuna, the viceroy, who, after hearing arguments from both sides, confirmed the division, but reversed the terms: nine parts were given to the son, and one to the Fathers.\nAlthough I am uncertain when the present letter will reach Your Lordship’s hands, nevertheless I did not wish to fail in this duty to kiss your hand; as your friends do also.\nFrom Venice, June 5, 1612.\nNotes\n\t1.\tPrinted as above, p. 477.\n\t2.\tThis mark of a lacuna (omission) appears in the first printing, indicated by asterisks.\n\t3.\tHere are their names (and see our note on p. 221): Countess Barbara Sanseverina; Count Orazio Simonetta, her husband; Marquis Giovanni Girolamo di Sala, Barbara’s son; Count Alfonso Sanvitale; Marquis Giovanni Francesco Sanvitale; Count Pio Torelli; Count Giovanni Battista Masi; Captain Bartolommeo Rovezan from Reggio; Oliviero de Olivieri from Parma; Onofrio Martani from Perugia. The last three were hanged: “After this event, a Jesuit Father preached a sermon from the scaffold where the said nobles had been beheaded, exhorting the city to remain loyal to its prince and not be frightened by this spectacle.” Such is the conclusion of a contemporary account.",

      "abstract": "In this letter of 25 September 1612, Fra Paolo Sarpi writes from Venice to Signor De l’Isle Groslot, thanking him for various manuscripts and books, among them texts about Jesuit privileges and a “Disputa politica.” Sarpi laments the growing power of the Jesuits in France and Europe, regrets the Venetian Republic’s isolation instead of forming alliances (notably with the Dutch), and mentions a newly uncovered plot against his own life reported by a cardinal in Rome. He explains how difficulties arose in transmitting important “memorie” (documents) to Monsieur de Thou—initially through Signor Nani—then devises a clandestine route via an English “minister” linked to Ambassador Wotton. Meanwhile, local tensions persist along the Habsburg–Venetian frontier (the Uskok raids). Sarpi hopes the discreet sharing of his papers can continue without exposing him to further danger and that future political alliances might yet materialize despite current inertia.",
      "transcription": "CCXIX. — Al signor De l’Isle Groslot.1\nScrissi a V.S. sotto il dì 11 di questo. Col presente ordinario ho ricevuto la sua delli 4 dell’istesso mese, insieme con la raccolta delli privilegi de’ Gesuiti, i quali io credo aver manoscritti tutti. Confronterò questo esemplare stampato col mio, e in caso che avessi alcuna pezza di più, la manderò.\nCon queste medesime ho ricevuto la Disputa politica, della quale avendo trascorso alcuni capi, veggo che l’autore ha di buone opinioni, e lo stimo. Solo mi pare che quella materia non dovesse esser trattata con così pochi argomenti, ma ricercasse maggior confirmazione e confutazione. Io credo che dagli altri libri che ha piaciuto al signor Gillot d’inviarmi, sarò per cavar profitto; perchè la negoziazione del Concilio di Pisa, nei suoi tempi, fu di molto momento. Io prego V.S. a far i dovuti ringraziamenti a quel signore, al quale io ho tanti obblighi, che non potrò corrispondere in minima parte. Aspetto di vedere la risposta del figlio di Barclaio,2 credendo, anzi essendo certo, di trovarci dentro di belle arguzie.\nIl libro della medesima materia stampato in Heidelberg, non è comparso in questo paese, ma \n[p. 342 modifica]\nvenerdì scriverò a Francoforte, chè di là mi sarà mandato più comodamente. Poichè i Gesuiti s’affaticano operando d’acquistar il dominio di Francia, anzi di Europa, e che non si vede modo al presente di far loro opposizione, è bene, almeno con le scritture, instituire la posterità, se in questi nostri sarà perduta: la quale però voglio anco sperare che non averanno forza di opprimere totalmente; e forse ancora piacerà a Dio che questi principii sveglino quelli a chi appartiene, e che si rimedi anco al male già fatto. Starò aspettando la relazione che V.S. mi promette, sopra il libro senza pari, che si tratta di metter in luce.\nIo ho sentito dispiacere così grande dell’incontro avvenuto a Richer, come fosse occorso a me stesso. Quella privazione del sindicato3 non nuoce solamente a lui, ma ancora alla causa. Io ne sono stato sempre in gran timore, e credo che quel signore dovrà aver innanzi gli occhi l’esempio dell’abate di Bois: il che non le dico senza ragione e senza qualche indizio.\nAvevo già inteso la dichiarazione del re della Gran Brettagna, molto savia e commendata. M’è piaciuto averla veduta formale, e ringrazio V.S. così di quella, come dell’altre pezze che li è piaciuto mandarmi.\nDi nuovo, un cardinale ha dato avviso all’ambasciatore della Repubblica in Roma, che è stato maneggiato una pratica contro la vita del padre Paolo: cosa che dà qualche disgusto al Senato.\nQuanto al negozio di monsieur di Thou, passò \n[p. 343 modifica]\nil successo in questa guisa. Avendo il padre conferito con il signor Nani il suo pensiero inclinato a mandar le memorie sue a monsieur di Thou, come cosa anco di onore per la Repubblica, e dimandatogli consiglio, rispose che non era cosa da consigliare, ma da eseguire: fosse dato a lui, chè ne avrebbe fatto l’ufficio. Il padre così fece; ma poi il signor Nani, o per dubbio che li venisse in mente, o perchè la cosa proposta in Collegio, si deliberò soprassedere; onde quello non le portò, e il Padre restò legato di non poter far altra risoluzione. Ecco quello ch’è passato. Al presente, desiderando che monsieur di Thou e il signor De l’Isle siano serviti, ho pensato un temperamento, il quale credo sarà facile, e senza che il Padre resti interessato. Era in questa città, con l’ambasciatore d’Inghilterra Wotton, un ministro, persona singolare: egli avendo letto le suddette cose, pregò il Padre di copia: in fine si contentò il Padre che le copiasse, non in italiano, come erano, ma in inglese; e ebbe li suoi rispetti, perchè pensasse poter far così, e non altrimente. Nell’allegata si scrive ad esso ministro, che ne faccia parte di tutto a monsieur di Thou. Sarà facile trovar in che terra egli abiti, informandosi da Wotton. Credo che monsieur de Thou sarà sodisfatto, e il Padre senza pericolo: ma la scrittura è lunga non meno d’un quinterno di carta.4\n[p. 344 modifica]\nLe considerazioni che mi fa V.S. intorno i bisogni della Repubblica, sono vere e vedute. La necessità che vi sarebbe di lega, massime con le Provincie unite, è notissima: ma io non posso senza estrema impazienza vedere che, essendo il mondo diviso in due parti, la sola Repubblica vuol fare da sè. Non è la causa il timor di Spagna, ma certo interesse, e poca intelligenza. Chi volesse effettuare questa buona opera, non bisognerebbe cominciar da qui, ma dall’introdurre una ambasceria mutua; chè, fatto questo, io averei l’altro come fatto. Ma un certo sussiego, chè non posso dir altro, è causa che chi dovrebbe parlarne, non ne parla. Il signor Foscarini so che ne ebbe delle proposizioni; ma dovendo andar in Inghilterra, penso che li suoi interessi ricercassero che differisca la trattazione al ritorno. Fece un errore,5 perchè al presente non è più atto per ciò. Aspettare che Barbarigo sia in Francia, è cosa lunga: quello che vi è, non è buono: io non saprei per ora dove voltarmi. Ma di ciò ne scriverò più lungamente con l’ordinario seguente, dopo averci pensato e conferito.\nDi nuovo non abbiamo altra cosa, se non che gli Uscocchi, dopo aver restituito il conte di Veggia, come credo già averli scritto, per il che si tenevano le differenze per composte, hanno fatto una incursione sopra lo stato della Repubblica, e menato via quantità di animali, avendo perciò dato danno di \n[p. 345 modifica]\nforse dieci mila scudi. Onde i nostri hanno fatto un’altra incursione molto maggiore, e penetrato negli Stati dell’arciduca per forsi venti miglia, hanno abbruciato e fatto danno, che si stima ascendere a non manco di 100 mila scudi; sebbene non sono rifatti di quel tanto ch’è stato preso a loro. Una parte e l’altra a tutti i confini sta su le guardie: si stima però, che le cose si componeranno. Piaccia a Dio che tutto quello che succede torni a sua gloria. Il quale prego che doni a V.S. tutte le sue grazie; e con questo fine, le bacio la mano, desiderando che per nome mio faccia affettuosissime raccomandazioni a monsieur di Thou e a monsieur l’Eschassier.\nMando a V.S. la lettera6 senza sigillarla, acciochè veda, se bene non intenderà che cosa gli dimandi, che lo dimando però con certezza che la mia volontà sarà eseguita.

      "transcription": "MY VERY GOOD LORD,\nHaving formerly given your Lordship a general accompt of the conclusion of this great business, it shall be now fit for me in divers respects to represent unto you the particularities thereof, and principally for the honour of the cause, which was the cause of God and of princes, his immediate ministers on earth.\n\t1.\tThat the two ecclesiastical delinquents, namely the Abbot of Nervesa and the Canonico di Vicenza, be granted at the requisition of the French King to the Pope.\n\t2.\tThat the Pope revoke his interdict, and signify the revocation thereof simply in College.\n\t3.\tThat an ambassador be sent to Rome after the said revocation.\n\t4.\tThat the Prince notify the agreement unto the clergy of their dominion by another manifesto repealing the former.\n\t5.\tThat the three decrees particularly mentioned in the Pope’s interdict, and all other their laws remain inviolable, only with promise to the French and Spanish Kings to use them moderately (according to the clemency of their ancestors) ; and this to be understood during only the time of farther informing the Pope upon what just respects they are grounded.\n\t6.\tThat all regular orders departed or banished hence upon this occasion, be licensed to return to their convents in the State, except the Jesuits.\nThus stand precisely the articles of the agreement, wherein both the books written in justification of the cause, and the persons of the writers (two of the mainest, and in all opinions most irreconcilable points), have been passed over on the Pope’s part, as it is thought with advantageous silence, as meaning peradventure to reserve the said writers to an ordinary course of proceeding by way of Inquisition.\nThe Senate after the conclusion of the rest, put it to ballotation what should be done with those men, by whom they had been so zealously, so learnedly, and indeed so necessarily served ; whereupon there passed a decree (worthy surely to be registered among the memorable resolutions that ever have been) not only to give them perpetual protection, but likewise perpetual pension.\nAnd it appeareth that there will be yet more use of them than of armour, which is hanged up after wars in some idle room, and oiled for fear of rusting ; for by our letters from Rome of this week, we find that the Pope’s instruments continue to write, and as maliciously as before, which presently shall be answered here ; and so I hope we shall keep on foot the war of the quill.\nNow in the formal or executory part of this agreement were observed the circumstances following.\nFirst, on Friday, the 20th of April, a secretary of the Senate, accompanied with the captain and other officers of the prisons, and for more abundant and rigorous caution with a public notary, bringeth unto the ordinary French ambassador at his house the foresaid two delinquents, consigning them unto him as prisoners granted to the Pope at the requisition of the French King his master, without prejudice of the State’s jurisdiction in like cases.\nThese by the said ambassador were consigned unto the Cardinal Joyeuse (as then in his house) in the presence of the said secretary ; in whose hearing (for he thought it ill manners to come away suddenly, as indeed he should have done) the ordinary French ambassador telleth the Cardinal that the said prisoners were granted by the State unto the Pope, in whose favour he omitted the repetition of the rest.\nAnd so the Cardinal received them, as now the Pope’s prisoners, the secretary as then saying nothing more; through which too fraudulent silence on the one side, and peradventure too modest on the other, there remaineth yet betwixt them some seeds of debate; the Signory thinking themselves saved (as justly they may do) by the form of the consignment and protestation, registered by a public notary; and the Cardinal thinking the Pope saved by that form which the ordinary French ambassador used to him.\nAnd this was all that the Pope hath had before the revocation of his censures, which he might have had in that form six months since, without any great offence to the cause, in my opinion.\nNow the morning following, the Cardinal cometh to the College, the Senate having first allowed the day ; and there, after some little preambles of the Pope’s fatherly goodness, pronounceth that he did levare le censure, still as a French ambassador, though this were the act of a Legate.\nFrom the College he goeth to the Church di Castello, whereof he seemeth to have made choice, for being the Patriarch’s parish, having been by precise order excluded from celebrating the mass in the Cathedral Church of St. Mark, and wheresoever without intervention of the Signory, without music, without noise of bells, or of artillery at the elevation, without any form of benediction or absolution, except the ordinary of the missal benedicat vos Deus, &c., finally without any public note of gladness or thankfulness, or so much as acknowledgement on their parts here.\nAnd so was the thing in all points performed ; unto which albeit there concurred the Spanish ambassadors and an abbot or two as assistants at the celebration, and those of the baser multitude, humorous of novelties, yet were neither the canons, nor musicians of the said church there, nor any of the Signory, nor above two of the whole nobility, and those such as might easily make their excuse of not being there for devotion ; neither I think in the memory of man was there ever known so still a day at the conclusion of troubles, nor universally so composed silence.\nThis was the end of the business both in form and substance, if it so end.\nGod keep your Lordship in His blessed favour.\nYour Lordship’s to do you hearty service,\nHENRY WOTTON.\nPostscript:\nI have annexed hereunto a copy of the articles of this conclusion as it was sent me from Rome, that your Lordship may see the golden fancies of that Court, and how they work upon the common man.\nThe cessation with you there (signified in your last of the 18th of April) doth seem unto all that have yet heard it the most prodigious thing of the world.",

      "abstract": "This letter from Henry Wotton to Sir Thomas Edmondes discusses two key issues: the political-religious tensions in the Grisons and the conversion of Tobie Matthew to Catholicism. Wotton reports on the ongoing struggle between the Grisons and the Spanish, highlighting Count Fuentes’ attempt to frame the conflict as a religious persecution to rally Catholic allies. He also mentions the fear that Archduke Maximilian of Tyrol may intervene, exacerbating tensions. Additionally, Wotton expresses disappointment at the conversion of Tobie Matthew, son of the Archbishop of York, lamenting the potential influence of Jesuits in exploiting his apostasy. The letter reflects Wotton’s concern for the Protestant cause in Europe and his broader intelligence-gathering efforts.",
      "transcription": "MY VERY GOOD LORD,\nYour Lordship’s of the 11th of July (for which I give you many thanks) hath this week almost settled my opinion touching the issue of those affairs, which seem to propend unto a peace; and I think we should here be much troubled therewith, if we were not called to the consideration of nearer evils, whereof I will give your Lordship a short accompt.\nIt may please you therefore to know that the Grisons (I mean the honester part of them) having prevailed over the Spanish side, so far as to execute some of the principal dependants of Spain, and to put the Bishop of Coira to flight, the Count Fuentes employed thither one of the Visconti of Milan, who, being as it seemeth, as cunning an instrument as Giulio della Torre was (who laid the first seeds) hath reduced the matter to a bandying of religions, upon this ground, that the parties were executed only for their conscience and Catholic faith; and so hath embarked not only the Popish Cantons actually in the cause, but likewise, as it is feared, the Archduke Maximilian (Vicegerent for the Emperor in the County of Tyrol), who had some particular interest in the person of Dominico Beli, one of the executed.\nAnd now the resident of this State at Coira writeth hither very desperately of the matter, having sent to the Senate the copy of a letter written from the Popish Cantons to Fuentes, wherein is this phrase: V. Eccellenza lasci la cura a noi di castigare questi furfanti, meaning the party of the Grisons opposite to the Spanish. These things breed here long and late consultations, and would likewise peradventure very much trouble the French ambassador, if he were not a gentleman of so able a spirit.\nGod produce out of it His own glory, and open a passage for His truth into this country.\nI have more to say which shall be said by the next post, and your Lordship will give me leave to spend the rest of this paper in bewailing unto, and with you, the fall of Mr. Tobie Mathew (a common acquaintance unto us both) from God’s only saving and single truth, to this idolatrous church, which (as hath been written unto me this week out of England) he did upon his arrival there not only plainly but boastingly profess unto my Lord of Salisbury and the Archbishop of Canterbury.\nAnd I have cause to be somewhat the more moved therewith, because he had, while he was in Florence, used my means in clearing that calumniation (as he called it) at home; and at his coming this way, he gave me very hearty thanks for the offices I had done therein.\nNeither do I think that before his meeting with that mountebank Bagshaw at Paris he was wholly apostamated.\nNow albeit upon this or the like accidents I am no more troubled in my own conscience and judgement, than if one had brought me news (according to our Italian proverb) of the death of a fly in Apulia; yet I cannot but be sensible of that scandal which will hence arrive to our Church, through his being the son of so great a prelate, and through the eminency of his own natural abilities, which will be the theme of the Jesuits to draw divers foolish inferior wits by his example.\nAnd so recommending your Lordship and your whole family unto the protection of our Lord Jesus, I humbly rest,\nYour Lordship’s to do you hearty service,\nHENRY WOTTON",

and this to be understood during only the time of farther informing the Pope upon what just respects they are grounded.\\n\\t6.\\tThat all regular orders departed or banished hence upon this occasion, be licensed to return to their convents in the State, except the Jesuits.\\nThus stand precisely the articles of the agreement, wherein both the books written in justification of the cause, and the persons of the writers (two of the mainest, and in all opinions most irreconcilable points), have been passed over on the Pope’s part, as it is thought with advantageous silence, as meaning peradventure to reserve the said writers to an ordinary course of proceeding by way of Inquisition.\\nThe Senate after the conclusion of the rest, put it to ballotation what should be done with those men, by whom they had been so zealously, so learnedly, and indeed so necessarily served ; whereupon there passed a decree (worthy surely to be registered among the memorable resolutions that ever have been) not only to give them perpetual protection, but likewise perpetual pension.\\nAnd it appeareth that there will be yet more use of them than of armour, which is hanged up after wars in some idle room, and oiled for fear of rusting ; for by our letters from Rome of this week, we find that the Pope’s instruments continue to write, and as maliciously as before, which presently shall be answered here ; and so I hope we shall keep on foot the war of the quill.\\nNow in the formal or executory part of this agreement were observed the circumstances following.\\nFirst, on Friday, the 20th of April, a secretary of the Senate, accompanied with the captain and other officers of the prisons, and for more abundant and rigorous caution with a public notary, bringeth unto the ordinary French ambassador at his house the foresaid two delinquents, consigning them unto him as prisoners granted to the Pope at the requisition of the French King his master, without prejudice of the State’s jurisdiction in like cases.\\nThese by the said ambassador were consigned unto the Cardinal Joyeuse (as then in his house) in the presence of the said secretary ; in whose hearing (for he thought it ill manners to come away suddenly, as indeed he should have done) the ordinary French ambassador telleth the Cardinal that the said prisoners were granted by the State unto the Pope, in whose favour he omitted the repetition of the rest.\\nAnd so the Cardinal received them, as now the Pope’s prisoners, the secretary as then saying nothing more; through which too fraudulent silence on the one side, and peradventure too modest on the other, there remaineth yet betwixt them some seeds of debate; the Signory thinking themselves saved (as justly they may do) by the form of the consignment and protestation, registered by a public notary; and the Cardinal thinking the Pope saved by that form which the ordinary French ambassador used to him.\\nAnd this was all that the Pope hath had before the revocation of his censures, which he might have had in that form six months since, without any great offence to the cause, in my opinion.\\nNow the morning following, the Cardinal cometh to the College, the Senate having first allowed the day ; and there, after some little preambles of the Pope’s fatherly goodness, pronounceth that he did levare le censure, still as a French ambassador, though this were the act of a Legate.\\nFrom the College he goeth to the Church di Castello, whereof he seemeth to have made choice, for being the Patriarch’s parish, having been by precise order excluded from celebrating the mass in the Cathedral Church of St. Mark, and wheresoever without intervention of the Signory, without music, without noise of bells, or of artillery at the elevation, without any form of benediction or absolution, except the ordinary of the missal benedicat vos Deus, &c., finally without any public note of gladness or thankfulness, or so much as acknowledgement on their parts here.\\nAnd so was the thing in all points performed ; unto which albeit there concurred the Spanish ambassadors and an abbot or two as assistants at the celebration, and those of the baser multitude, humorous of novelties, yet were neither the canons, nor musicians of the said church there, nor any of the Signory, nor above two of the whole nobility, and those such as might easily make their excuse of not being there for devotion ; neither I think in the memory of man was there ever known so still a day at the conclusion of troubles, nor universally so composed silence.\\nThis was the end of the business both in form and substance, if it so end.\\nGod keep your Lordship in His blessed favour.\\nYour Lordship’s to do you hearty service,\\nHENRY WOTTON.\\nPostscript:\\nI have annexed hereunto a copy of the articles of this conclusion as it was sent me from Rome, that your Lordship may see the golden fancies of that Court, and how they work upon the common man.\\nThe cessation with you there (signified in your last of the 18th of April) doth seem unto all that have yet heard it the most prodigious thing of the world.\",\n \"metadata\": {\n   \"document_type\": \"letter\",\n   \"author\": \"Edmondes, Thomas\",\n   \"recipient\": \"Lake, Thomas\",\n   \"date_place\": \"18-May-1607\",\n   \"keywords\": \"Venetian conflict with the Papacy, revocation of the Pope’s interdict, return of religious orders, Jesuits, Venetian Senate, Cardinal de Joyeuse\",\n   \"abstract\": \"This letter from Henry Wotton to Sir Thomas Edmondes, dated May 18, 1607, provides a detailed account of the resolution of the Venetian conflict with the Papacy.

He reports that the Pope has issued a “censure” against the King’s recently published book—one that defends the English Oath of Allegiance and clarifies James’s religious stance. The Pope personally gave a copy of this condemnation to the Venetian ambassador’s secretary, intending to prevent Venice from receiving James’s “blessed labours.” Wotton relays that covert demand for King James’s book is high, and many in Venice secretly desire copies. Wotton’s chaplain has translated the King’s work into Italian, seeking input from Fra Paolo Sarpi and Fulgenzio Micanzio. Both friars admire James’s confessional summary and see him as especially suited, “above all [his] predecessors,” to extend true religion not just in Europe but also in America (“Nova Britannia”). Meanwhile, Wotton thanks the King for letting him remain longer in Venice before returning to England.The postscript adds that the Grand Duke of Tuscany has burned James’s book under the Inquisition’s direction, the Spanish ambassador claims the Duke of Savoy rejected it, and in Rome it was publicly banned and equated with Beza’s Confessions. Yet Wotton suggests that such prohibitions only heighten curiosity among curious Venetians.",

The Pope personally gave a copy of this condemnation to the Venetian ambassador’s secretary, intending to prevent Venice from receiving James’s “blessed labours.” Wotton relays that covert demand for King James’s book is high, and many in Venice secretly desire copies. Wotton’s chaplain has translated the King’s work into Italian, seeking input from Fra Paolo Sarpi and Fulgenzio Micanzio. Both friars admire James’s confessional summary and see him as especially suited, “above all [his] predecessors,” to extend true religion not just in Europe but also in America (“Nova Britannia”). Meanwhile, Wotton thanks the King for letting him remain longer in Venice before returning to England.The postscript adds that the Grand Duke of Tuscany has burned James’s book under the Inquisition’s direction, the Spanish ambassador claims the Duke of Savoy rejected it, and in Rome it was publicly banned and equated with Beza’s Confessions. Yet Wotton suggests that such prohibitions only heighten curiosity among curious Venetians.\"\n },\n \"markers_of_conspiratorial_language\": {\n   \"modal_verbs\": [\n     \"should\",\n     \"could\",\n     \"must\",\n     \"may\",\n     \"might\"\n   ],\n   \"evaluative_language\": [\n     \"secret means\",\n     \"incredible celerity\",\n     \"blessed labours\",\n     \"singular learning and zeal\",\n     \"admirable summary\",\n     \"most impudently slandered\",\n     \"equanimity and moderation\",\n     \"eminent measure\",\n     \"great opportunity\",\n     \"removed clime\"\n   ],\n   \"syntax_and_conditional_constructions\": [\n     \"if one of your Majesty’s best ships were laden therewith and sent to this port, we should find means to vent them\",\n     \"with intention to forebar\",\n     \"I cannot but believe\",\n     \"as for my part\",\n     \"though the enclosed notes...\",\n     \"though otherwise excellently blessed\"\n   ],\n   \"discourse_markers\": [\n     \"I think on my conscience\",\n     \"seemeth (upon the computation)\",\n     \"cannot but believe\",\n     \"no doubt purposely\",\n     \"as the best and wisest say here\",\n     \"which giveth me just occasion\"\n   ],\n   \"punctuation\": [\n     \"parentheses\",\n     \"em dash\",\n     \"semicolons\"\n   ]\n },\n \"analysis_overview\": {\n   \"segments\": [\n     \"Wotton obtaining the censure and the Pope's actions (main body first part)\",\n     \"Secret demand and translation (main body second part)\",\n     \"Postscript: intelligence on the book's reception\"\n   ],\n   \"no_of_excerpts\": {\n     \"observed\": 6,\n     \"rumored\": 2,\n     \"inferred\": 4\n   }\n },\n \"excerpts\": [\n   {\n     \"excerpt\": \"I have now by secret means gotten a copy of that censure (for so they call it)\",\n     \"gcma_classification\": \"observed\",\n     \"explanation_of_chosen_gcma_type\": \"This is a factual statement of covert action by Wotton himself, detailing his procurement of sensitive material through clandestine means.

      "abstract": "This letter, written by Sir Henry Wotton to King James I on January 21, 1610, describes how Henry IV of France attempted to undermine Protestant activities in Venice by using an intercepted letter to expose covert Protestant networks. Giovanni Diodati, an Italian Protestant theologian from Geneva, had written to a French official about Protestant affairs in Venice. Somehow, the letter fell into the hands of the Jesuit Father Pierre Cotton, Henry IV’s confessor, who then showed it to the French king. Henry IV forwarded copies to the Pope and the French ambassador in Venice, who delayed its presentation for strategic reasons, possibly waiting for Papalist factions in the Venetian Senate to prepare the ground. Wotton interprets these actions as part of a broader French effort to curry favor with Rome, possibly as preparation for a future alliance or to facilitate the return of the Jesuits to Venice. Wotton also notes a subtle but significant pressure campaign directed at Paolo Sarpi, urging him to seek papal absolution. The letter reflects England’s diplomatic interest in countering Catholic influence in Venice and maintaining its Protestant allies.",

      "abstract": "In this letter dated 4 May 1618 from Venice, Henry Wotton addresses two primary subjects: Doctor Marta and his Lord Rosse. He first discusses complaints and secret business relating to a particular “use” that pertains to his role in state affairs—a matter he hopes to have mediated by the recipient’s honorable influence. Wotton then turns to issues regarding Lord Rosse’s conduct abroad. He reports intelligence that Rosse, accompanied by Diego, voluntarily submitted himself to the Court of Inquisition—an act interpreted by English Jesuits as suspect. The letter further details how Rosse’s behavior appears designed to facilitate the conversion and subsequent liberation of a certain Mr Mole, whose change of faith is linked to Rosse’s example. Wotton also mentions the bearer, Captain Henry Bell, commending his military skill despite his modest fortunes. Overall, the letter interweaves personal complaints, confidential state business, and observations on the shifting religious allegiances among English exiles, reflecting the turbulent political and religious climate of early seventeenth‑century Europe.",
      "transcription": "Right Honorable\nI will in this only present through your favourable handes two last particular notes about Doctor Marta and my Lord Rosse.\nPage 14\nfrom mine owne aduise but he should rather direct his writings immediatly to his Maiestie or to your handes ; imagining he would be more substantiall when he should send to the Fountayne : for his papers to me were very empty save of complement or importunitie for monies. Now, to speake somewhat farther of him without passion or wrong :\nHis Ma^ in his verbal instructions at my departure after some precaution about the keeping of him still in appetite referred me in the rest to my Predecessour : from whom I tooke a very right Character of the man : that there was good to be made of him but I should find him full of Neapolitanarie which well translated are shiftes. I came therefore prepared with this information not so much to consider his nature as his Vse. And accordingly when I some tyme after my arrival receaued from him certayne wilde proiects (which I represented to S^ Raph Winwood to his Ma^) I aduised him to beginne some solid worcke touching the Roman Churche : being a practised man in that Court and besides well versed in the Canon lawes — which is the forge of all their abuses : Vppon this perswasion he composed the Booke I sent by one an English Marchant who deliuered the same to S^ Raph Winwood though I never heard more of it. In that Booke was a last Chapter how the Pope doeth gouerne the Princes of his flock : whereof he only sent the Tytle reseruing the treatice craftily enough because he knewe how much I desired it. Hinc illae lachrymae. For from this hath risen all expostulation betweene him and me (as I had aduisement) about his payments (saue onely so much as appeareth in the Bill of extraordinaries) and him still crying to perfect that Chapter as the most meritorious part ; wherein he should well deserue of his Maiestie and of the Christian World by laying open the Roman trickes. I therefore wishe that his Ma^ would be pleased by your letter to take notice in a word or two vnto him of those Chapters that the King hath already receaued (for so I suppose) and expresse his long expectation of the last Chapter and laye the fault vppon me that his petition hath not been payed\nPage 15\nbecause I still kept the King in hope of the last and cheefest part. Vppon the receyte whereof his Ma^ meaning was to send him the whole together. Something dressed in this fashion will serue two turnes : bothe to content him and excite him. I haue in the meane tyme intertayned an excuse : first grownded vppon the Kings absence in Scotland then the death of S^ Raph Winwood who was best acquainted with his propositions, and lastly, for want of a particular Patent by vertue whereof such monies as shall be payed him here may be redemaunded at home of my Lord Threasurer. One thing I had almost forgotten which he tooke somewhat vnkindly and vniustly.\nI pressed him to finishe the foresayed worcke when he told me he had an other thing in hande de prohibitione librorum whereof the scope was to perswade the Italians to a reading for information of their consciences : wherein I gaue him all possible incouragement as well as in the other : but when he would haue dedicated it to me I refused that curtesie because my name would haue giuen some scandal vnto it before the reading, and so haue frustrated the fruict besides such prayers wherewith he had laden me in the Epistle as would haue taken away all credit from the rest. Howsoeuer, now I see because I was vncapable of his commendations he hath made me the subiect of his complaints : though both vndeseruedly.\nI conclude about him let me say no more. He bewrayeth a desire of quitting his profession and retiring vnder your view : If the King shall conceiue more vse of him there then here I will attend his Ma^ good pleasure.\nNow, concerning the points required about my L Rosse, I meane how by my intelligence he proceeded at Rome and may be made good vppon his owne promises of returne : honesting his absence (as it seemeth) by some privat end that he aymes at abroade.\nSurely to this proceeding he yet is been vnsutable. For at his first arrival in that rotten place even before he had visited his owne Cuntrimen he went with Diego and submitted himself to the Court of Inquisition (thinking as the English Jesuites doe there interpret it who were somewhat distasted that a man of such qualitie did not passe thorough their handes) that such a voluntarie offer would haue been taken without any farther probation, but therein (if that were his drift) he was deceaued. For the Inquisitours did tender him either an oathe or a forme of confession (for in this poynt my intelligence is not cleere) but whatsoeuer it was he swallowed it : which done and voiced among our Cuntrimen they beganne to worcke vppon M^ Mole by his example telling him that my Lord Rosse was become a sound Roman Catholique : when that is so (replies the poore gentleman) I will be so my self. Vppon which words (though spoken a la volee) a gentleman was imployed (see how nimble they are) to wish my Lord Rosse to open his conscience also to M^ Mole whose conuersion did depend vppon his. This brought them together though (for aught I heare yet) to small purpose.\nPage 16\nOf other particular circumstances of his behaviour there I haue formerly written. What iudgment may be made vppon the whole I leaue to his Ma^ wisedome. For my part, I can conceiue no imaginable pretext of any privat scope that he can haue vnlesse it be to procure M^ Moles libertie by way or couler of conuersion, which I thinke he would hardly alleadge for any excuse of his owne travayles. And thus much in answer of the two poynts required by you. When I shall vnderstande more I will discharge my dutie.\nThis bearer Captayn Henry Bell was recommended to the State by his Ma^ letters and to me by yours. He hath here increased rather his observation then his fortune. I leaue the report of my endeuours for him to himself. Surely he is a man of great skill and experience in the militarie way, and of a right honest composition in the Civill : but such is the iniquitie of fortune that such a State as this will make a Wassenhouen a Colonel (who was before but a tuner of Virginals) and refuse the offers of an able man. I haue here made with him domestical acquaintance, and found his temper so fayre and discreete that I am bounde (Sir) to reuert those commendations that you sent by him hether vnto your selfe whose loue may more avayle him.\nHe bringeth a letter from me to the King : wherein I shall then handle the businesse his Ma^ to graunt me leaue to returne towards this next Winter ; by which time I hope this Cuntrie will be at ease ; and I haue been nine yeares his Ma^ servant in this place if I reckon from my beginning and steere if I reckon from my last Commission. So in respect of the tyme it is no irregular request. I humbly beseeche you (Sir) that y^ favourable mediation may make it every way more easy. I confesse this last tyme I haue liued like a decumbent yet seldome in cheerefull health by reason of those distillations from my head into my brest which I found it now in this vaporous ayre : And perhaps I haue lesser vigour to resist it. Besides, though my fortune compasse me not with many occasions : yet of those who wishe me home I may chance a Widoe that will devoure me. In truth I am much bound to y^ Honour for your good offices with the King in my behalf.\nAnd so I rest\nVenice this 4^ of May, 1618.\nWith most desire\nto serue you\nHenry Wotton.\nPage 17\nRight Honorable\nI will now onely present through your favourable handes two last notes about Doctor Marta and my Lord Rosse.",

He reveals that the Pope intends to issue a Bull of Pius V excommunicating those obstructing the Inquisition’s work. The Republic is resisting these efforts, particularly by protecting Fra Paolo Sarpi, an outspoken critic of papal authority, and granting him a stipend. The letter also touches on political and military matters, mentioning the confirmed alliance between the Prince of Florence and the Queen of Spain’s sister, uncertainty over the Grand Duke’s fleet, and skepticism regarding the feasibility of a Cyprus expedition. Additionally, Don Antonio (Sir Anthony Sherley) has arrived in Naples, asserting influence in the Council but remaining elusive about his reception into the Order of Santiago. There are rumors of his possible travel to Ferrara and the Emperor’s court.",

      "abstract": "This letter from Wotton to Lord Zouche reports on Wotton’s personal illness, the visit of Archduke Maximilian to Rome, and the broader political maneuvering surrounding his visit. Wotton describes Maximilian’s humble attire upon his arrival in Rome, emphasizing his religious piety and the clandestine nature of his interactions with Jesuits and Cardinal Madrutz. The Pope, having recently staged an illness due to a prior political incident, was hesitant to meet the Archduke but eventually did so. There is speculation about the purpose of Maximilian’s visit. Some believed it was to prevent the marriage between the King of Poland (Sigismund III) and a daughter of Austria, but others dismissed this theory in favor of the idea that Maximilian sought Papal intervention to pressure the Emperor into abdicating either the Roman or Hungarian crown in his favor. The letter also notes that the Pope presented Maximilian with a religious relic and a gold medaglia, laden with indulgences—a gesture Wotton dismisses with sarcasm. On a personal note, Wotton discusses his continued residence in Florence at the house of Bacchio Boni, his financial concerns, and his likely stay in Italy over the summer. The letter closes with a request to remain informed of any relevant political affairs.",
      "transcription": "Florence, May 29, 1592\nMost Honoured Lord,\nSince my last, written unto your Honour from Florence, till this present, I have had a very unquiet time; \n\nI was with my last journey much distempered, which could not cause less than an ague. In sickness we have care of our life and forget our duties: so that I have rested your Honour’s debtor for the peregrination of the Archduke Maximilian to Rome three posts, which I will now pay. \n\nHis Highness arrived in the city on Tuesday in the Settimana Santa, as they term it, accompanied with three others, of which one went for the master of all. The Archduke was attired in slight leather, without any manner of trimming, his hat buttoned up on the one side, his cloak clasped together in the neck, and turned over upon his shoulder, the one side of his face, and a good part of his forehead, handled like a servant newly come from blacking his master’s saddle. The first, second, and better part of the third day, he spent in religious services, as beholding the relics, visitation of the seven churches, etc.\nOn Thursday toward evening, he discovered himself to two Jesuits, that were lately come from Vienna, meaning to be brought by them unto the Cardinal Madrutz. \nThe Cardinal used practick to bring him to the Pope, which then was not easy, for an accident had fallen out in Rome, that occasioned the Pope to feign himself sick from Thursday before Easter to the Saturday after Easter, as I signified unto your Honour. \nNotwithstanding, Madrutz dealt in it with exceeding diligence, and the Archduke came to conference with the Pope in the Vatican on Friday at night before Easter. \n\nThe cause of his coming was more conjecturable than certain; for though men of great judgment held that it was only to withstand the marriage between the King of Poland and the daughter of Austria, yet wanted not some that said the Archduke had given over those desires. The time was too scant for such an effect, the match crossed not his proceedings; and further, the Pope was not to be dealt with that way, who had delegated some thirty days before the Cardinal Razevil into those parts to no other effect than to consummate the marriage. So that it was rather to be thought he came to have the Emperor solicited by Papal letters to surrender unto him the Roman crown, or that of Hungary: this was the second opinion.\nSince his departure (which was presently after the Holy Days), we hear the marriage day (appointed as on the 26th of April past), to have been rejourned till that day three weeks following. Some stirs are expected. The Pope’s present unto him at his leave-taking was a medaglia in gold, of his own person, and a hollow jewel, having in it a piece of the cross on which Christ was crucified (as he made him believe) and annexed unto it an indulgence of 8,000 years (notable religion!).\nTouching my private self, I continue in the house of Signor Bacchio Boni, in Via Larga, where I am reasonably well accommodated, but for my ten crowns a month. The times are dear in extremity.\nI think to remain in these parts this summer; and, as I imagine, between your Honour’s departure out of Italy and mine, there will be no great difference. If anything occur wherein I may serve your Honour, I beseech it will please you not to let me be ignorant of it.

Written this 28th of December, 1592.\nMost Honourable,\nHaving in my three last unto your Honour signified by cipher certain dangerous points, I will in this set down the occurrences in matter of public estate. The great expectation which ran of these last four tempera, concerning the number of cardinals, is fallen out quite contrary; the Pope having on Wednesday morning in the Consistory used to the Illustrissimi these words: “Ora sono Papa, fin ora non son stato Papa, non adJieriro a nessun Principe, non faro de’ Cardinali, Iddio vi benediea”; words directly proceeding against the opinion of all, but crossing none more immediately than the Father Toledo, toward whom the Pope is known to have particular inclination.\nThus much is certain, that Toledo, having given order to one of the Buonacorsi in this town to be ready upon his call, did dispatch a courier for him the Saturday before the four tempora, something seeming to have fallen between the calicem supremaque labra. The College hath lately lost the Cardinals Canano, Mondovio, and Sans. The first died in Modena, to the especial discomfort of the house of Este, as if all stars that gave light that way were under the horizon. By the death of the other two, the Conclave hath received little alteration; though Mondovio were papable, and a great soggetto in the list of the forestieri, and sometime schoolmaster to the King of France.\nThe two princes of the house of Bavaria (who passed by these parts toward Rome, as it were making haste), were entertained a while at Caprarola upon the Pope’s commandment, that things might be prepared the better in the meantime, as it is interpreted. Of the elder brother’s promotion there is now general silence, men seeing servitors of the Court, and even nephews neglected; which, some say, the Pope hath done to conclude his first year with a point of great moderation.\nIn the Great Duke’s estate there is little change, or inclination to change, save that Signieur Silvio is made admiral of his galleys; either for his own sufficiency that way, or (as some think) to sweeten the humours of that family, not a little inasperated by the death of Alfonso. Don Pietro di Medici we hear to be married in Spain to the daughter of the Duke of Alba Regale, having obtained of the King the chancellorship of the great Order of St. Jago.\nThe marriage of the Prince Doria with the daughter of Marcantonio Colonna (sometime Viceroy in Sicily) hath been gallantly celebrated in Genoua. The elder Baron of Harrach is expected daily to pass by these parts, as the Emperor’s lieger in Rome, whom I hear to be a gentleman of very mature judgment.\nThe death of the Duke of Parma hath put many into disputation about the successor, and some are of opinion that the King will divide the charges, placing in the Low Countries two persons, the one regent for his Majesty, the other Lieutenant-General over the garrisons, artillery, munition, and all points military. The Prince’s death was in the manner of a dropsy, occasioned through drinking of too much water, which was counselled him against his gout. His Requiem they sang in Rome on the seventeenth of the present, the Cardinal Duartes, his son, as then retired out of the city. It is said to have caused some slight mutiny in Antwerp.\nThe effects that are to follow will, I hope, afford me better matter for my next unto your Honour, of whose estate I most humbly desire to hear. And so in great haste (my good, good Lord) I commend myself unto the continuance of your Honour’s favour and love towards me, wishing him in earnest a blissful end of his designs.\nYour Honour’s most faithful servant,\nH.

The great expectation which ran of these last four tempera, concerning the number of cardinals, is fallen out quite contrary; the Pope having on Wednesday morning in the Consistory used to the Illustrissimi these words: “Ora sono Papa, fin ora non son stato Papa, non adJieriro a nessun Principe, non faro de’ Cardinali, Iddio vi benediea”; words directly proceeding against the opinion of all, but crossing none more immediately than the Father Toledo, toward whom the Pope is known to have particular inclination.\\nThus much is certain, that Toledo, having given order to one of the Buonacorsi in this town to be ready upon his call, did dispatch a courier for him the Saturday before the four tempora, something seeming to have fallen between the calicem supremaque labra. The College hath lately lost the Cardinals Canano, Mondovio, and Sans. The first died in Modena, to the especial discomfort of the house of Este, as if all stars that gave light that way were under the horizon. By the death of the other two, the Conclave hath received little alteration; though Mondovio were papable, and a great soggetto in the list of the forestieri, and sometime schoolmaster to the King of France.\\nThe two princes of the house of Bavaria (who passed by these parts toward Rome, as it were making haste), were entertained a while at Caprarola upon the Pope’s commandment, that things might be prepared the better in the meantime, as it is interpreted. Of the elder brother’s promotion there is now general silence, men seeing servitors of the Court, and even nephews neglected; which, some say, the Pope hath done to conclude his first year with a point of great moderation.\\nIn the Great Duke’s estate there is little change, or inclination to change, save that Signieur Silvio is made admiral of his galleys; either for his own sufficiency that way, or (as some think) to sweeten the humours of that family, not a little inasperated by the death of Alfonso. Don Pietro di Medici we hear to be married in Spain to the daughter of the Duke of Alba Regale, having obtained of the King the chancellorship of the great Order of St. Jago.\\nThe marriage of the Prince Doria with the daughter of Marcantonio Colonna (sometime Viceroy in Sicily) hath been gallantly celebrated in Genoua. The elder Baron of Harrach is expected daily to pass by these parts, as the Emperor’s lieger in Rome, whom I hear to be a gentleman of very mature judgment.\\nThe death of the Duke of Parma hath put many into disputation about the successor, and some are of opinion that the King will divide the charges, placing in the Low Countries two persons, the one regent for his Majesty, the other Lieutenant-General over the garrisons, artillery, munition, and all points military. The Prince’s death was in the manner of a dropsy, occasioned through drinking of too much water, which was counselled him against his gout. His Requiem they sang in Rome on the seventeenth of the present, the Cardinal Duartes, his son, as then retired out of the city. It is said to have caused some slight mutiny in Antwerp.\\nThe effects that are to follow will, I hope, afford me better matter for my next unto your Honour, of whose estate I most humbly desire to hear. And so in great haste (my good, good Lord) I commend myself unto the continuance of your Honour’s favour and love towards me, wishing him in earnest a blissful end of his designs.\\nYour Honour’s most faithful servant,\\nH.
